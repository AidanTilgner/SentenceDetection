<h2>Why do I need sentence detection?</h2>
<p>
    Aside from being a fun project to work on, sentence detection will help me 
    configure responses to certain inputs that a user might give. This is primarily for
    my chatbox/virtual assistant, Onyx. (Check that out at https://github.com/AidanTilgner/Onyx)
